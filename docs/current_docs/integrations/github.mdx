## Authentication for Private Repositories

When working with private repositories in GitHub Actions, see our [Git Credential Helpers Guide](/guides/ci/git-credential-helpers#github-actions) for authentication patterns. For private modules, refer to the [Remote Repositories documentation](/manuals/user/remote-repositories).

## Best Practices

When working with private repositories:
1. Start with a draft PR
2. Wait for confirmation before making the PR "ready for review"
3. Ignore CI and focus on local testing
4. Always rebase on main and force-push to the branch after each change

## Examples

dagger call foo --directory=https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY#pull/NUMBER/merge

If your GitHub repository contains a Dagger module, you can test the functionality of a specific branch by calling the Dagger module with the corresponding pull request URL, as shown below:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY@pull/NUMBER/merge --help
```

You can also use a Dagger Function in a GitHub Actions workflow to publish a container image to GitHub Container Registry.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/github-ghcr.yml
```
